Breeze is an **alternative context menu** for Windows 10 and Windows 11.

## Fluent

Breeze is designed with animations in mind.

All animations are configurable and can be scaled and disabled as you want.
## Extensible

Empowered by the embedded JavaScript script api, Breeze enables you to extend
the functionalities of your context menu in a few lines of code.

```javascript
shell.menu_controller.add_menu_listener((e) => {
  e.menu.add({
    type: "button",
    name: "Shuffle Buttons",
    action: () => {
      for (const item of menus) {
        item.set_position(Math.floor(menus.length * Math.random()));
      }
    },
  }, 0);
});
```

## Configurable
Breeze shell exposed a bunch of configurations ranging from item height to background radius method. Customize them as you need.

[Configuration Document →](./CONFIG.md)

The config menu of breeze-shell can be found as you open your `Data Folder` and right-click anywhere inside it.

## Lightweight & Fast

Breeze uses breeze-ui, which is implemented to be a cross-platform, simple,
animation-friendly and fast ui library for modern C++, with the support of both
NanoVG and ThorVG render context. This allowed Breeze to have a delicated user
interface in ~2MiB.
